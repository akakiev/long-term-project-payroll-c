2. <b>showvalue()</b>: This function is used to print the data.
3. <b>deposit()</b>: This function helps to deposit money in a particular account.
4. <b>showbal()</b>: This function shows the total balance available after deposition.
5. <b>withdrawl()</b>: This function helps to withdraw money from the account.

<b>Automated Teller Machine (ATM)</b> also known as ABM (Automated Banking Machine) is a banking system. This banking system allows customers or users to have access to financial transactions. These transactions can be done in public space without any need for a clerk, cashier, or bank teller.
